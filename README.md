# System-Bench-Marking-app-using-Java
Java System Benchmarking Tool
This project is a compact Java application that performs and visualizes key system performance metrics. Using the JFreeChart library, it runs benchmarks for CPU, multithreading, GPU, RAM, storage, and IOPS. The results are displayed in a clear, interactive bar chart, providing an at-a-glance overview of component performance. It is an excellent educational tool for understanding fundamental system metrics and data visualization in Java
